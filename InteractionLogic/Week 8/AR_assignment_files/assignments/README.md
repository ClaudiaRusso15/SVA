**Assignment 1 (ASTRO)**
I replaced the original gltf file with one of an astronaut. Something that I notice
while doing this assingment is that when I move my phone up and down it looks like
the astronaut is jumping in space.

**Assignment 2 (video)**

For this assignment, I wanted to immerse ourselves into another reality. 
I downloaded a VR video from Youtube and converted it into a .mp4 file. The 
video I foundhad a 360 degrees photo on a street, that when you zoomed in it 
felt like you were standing there.
