My idea was to use an existing interactive VR video that could be controller by scaning the marker. 
I think this could be used for educational purposes where students can navigate and scan things. However,
I'm not quite sure if this was the correct way to do this. The video stops every time something covers the marker.
So, would definitely want to know how to do something like this!
